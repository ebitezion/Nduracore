# BSV BLOCKCHAIN | Software Development Kit for Go

Welcome to the BSV Blockchain Libraries Project, the comprehensive Go SDK designed to provide an updated and unified layer for developing scalable applications on the BSV Blockchain. This SDK addresses the limitations of previous tools by offering a fresh, peer-to-peer approach, adhering to SPV, and ensuring privacy and scalability.

## Objective

The BSV Blockchain Libraries Project aims to structure and maintain a middleware layer of the BSV Blockchain technology stack. By facilitating the development and maintenance of core libraries, it serves as an essential toolkit for developers looking to build on the BSV Blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To add the SDK to your Go module:

```bash
go get github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a [simple example](https://goplay.tools/snippet/WotzYGbOSQ6) of using the SDK to create and sign a P2PKH transaction:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    ec "github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/primitives/ec"
    "github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/transaction"
    "github.com/bsv-blockchain/go-sdk/transaction/template/p2pkh"
)

func main() {
    // 1) Load a private key (WIF shown for example purposes)
    priv, _ := ec.PrivateKeyFromWif("KznvCNc6Yf4iztSThoMH6oHWzH9EgjfodKxmeuUGPq5DEX5maspS")

    // 2) Create a new transaction
    tx := transaction.NewTransaction()

    // 3) Build an unlocker for P2PKH
    unlocker, _ := p2pkh.Unlock(priv, nil)

    // 4) Add an input with its source output details
    //    If you don't have the source tx, fetch satoshis+lockingScript for the outpoint
    _ = tx.AddInputFrom(
        "11b476ad8e0a48fcd40807a111a050af51114877e09283bfa7f3505081a1819d", // prev txid
        0,                                                                  // vout
        "76a9144bca0c466925b875875a8e1355698bdcc0b2d45d88ac",              // source locking script
        1500,                                                               // source satoshis
        unlocker,                                                           // unlocking script template
    )

    // 5) Add an output
    _ = tx.PayToAddress("1AdZmoAQUw4XCsCihukoHMvNWXcsd8jDN6", 1000)

    // 6) Sign all inputs with attached templates
    if err := tx.Sign(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    log.Printf("tx hex: %s\n", tx.Hex())
}

```
