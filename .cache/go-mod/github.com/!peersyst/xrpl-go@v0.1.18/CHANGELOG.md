### Added

#### xrpl

### Changed

#### Makefile

- Changed localnet rippled image to `develop`
- Exposed RPC port in localnet command
- Use `gotest` (colorized output) with fallback to `go test`

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- Validate `DomainID` is valid hexadecimal in `IsDomainID` check (previously only checked length).
- Validate `MPTokenMetadata` length (max 1024 bytes) in `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` (previously only checked hex format).
- Reject `MPTokenIssuanceSet` when `Holder` equals `Account` (`temMALFORMED` per rippled spec).
- Validate `MPTokenIssuanceID` is valid hexadecimal in `MPTokenIssuanceSet`, `MPTokenIssuanceDestroy`, and `MPTokenAuthorize` (previously only checked non-empty).
- `PaymentChannelCreate.Flatten()` and `PaymentChannelFund.Flatten()` now set `TransactionType` in flattened output.

#### binary-codec

- `UInt64` type now validates hex string length (max 16 chars) before padding, preventing silent overflow.

#### xrpl/websocket

- `GetResult` now composes a `jsonUnmarshalerHookFunc` alongside the existing `TextUnmarshallerHookFunc`, so any target type implementing `json.Unmarshaler` is decoded via its own `UnmarshalJSON` rather than by mapstructure directly.

#### xrpl/queries/server/types

- `State.ValidatorListExpires` remains a `string`; a custom `UnmarshalJSON` on `State` now accepts both a JSON string and a JSON number for that field, converting the number to its string representation. This fixes a crash when rippled returns `0` for `validator_list_expires` over WebSocket.

#### xrpl/ledger-entry-types

- Fixed `AuthAccount.Flatten()` storing `types.Address` without converting to `string`, causing binary codec serialization to fail.

#### Makefile

- Corrected localnet setup to automatically create ledgers periodically

### Removed

#### xrpl/transaction

- Removed integration tests for obsolete transactions `Batch` and `DelegateSet`

## [v0.1.17]

### Fixed

#### pkg/crypto

- **Fixed a bug in secp256k1 `deriveScalar` where the discriminator and iteration counter were written to the input seed slice instead of their own buffers.** The old code wrote `discrim` and `i` values into `bytes[0..3]` (the caller's seed) rather than into `discrimBytes[0..3]` and `shiftBytes[0..3]`, causing two problems:
  1. **Input mutation**: the seed passed by the caller was silently corrupted on every call.
  2. **Zero-hashing**: the actual `discrimBytes` and `shiftBytes` arrays were never populated, so the hash always received zeros regardless of the discriminator or iteration values.
- **Practical impact was limited**: because the hash of the seed is written *before* the mutation, and the first iteration (`i = 0`) with `discrim = 0` produces the same zeros in both the buggy and fixed code paths, the bug was invisible for the overwhelmingly common case (a valid scalar is found on the first try, which happens with probability ~1 − 2⁻²⁵⁶). The bug would only produce incorrect results in the astronomically rare scenario where the first hash overflows the curve order or is zero, triggering a retry with the now-corrupted seed. No real-world keypair derivation is believed to have been affected.
- Replaced manual DER signature encoding/decoding with the `dcrec/secp256k1` library's `Serialize()` and `ParseDERSignature()`, and replaced `btcsuite/btcd/btcec/v2` with `decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4` (v4.4.1).

#### xrpl/transaction

- **`BaseTx.Flatten()` now preserves `Sequence: 0` when `TicketSequence` is set.** Previously, the condition `if tx.Sequence != 0` caused `Sequence` to be omitted from the flattened transaction when its value was `0`. This caused `Autofill` to overwrite it with the account's current sequence number, resulting in both a non-zero `Sequence` and a `TicketSequence` being present — which the server rejects with `temSEQ_AND_TICKET`.

#### xrpl

- Fixed struct-typed JSON fields not being omitted from JSON output when zero-valued. Previously, `omitempty` was used but had no effect on struct types, causing empty structs to always be serialized. Replaced with `omitzero` (Go 1.24+) to match the original intent.
- `waitForTransaction` in both RPC and WebSocket clients now checks `txResponse.Validated` and returns early once the transaction is confirmed, instead of only relying on ledger sequence. The RPC client also now handles `txnNotFound` errors gracefully during the polling loop.
- RPC client now applies a default timeout (`common.DefaultTimeout`) to the HTTP client. `NewClientConfig` keeps `Config.timeout` and `http.Client.Timeout` in sync, if the HTTP client already has a custom timeout it is respected, otherwise the config default is applied.

## [v0.1.16]

### Added

#### binary-codec

- Added `Int32` serialized type with two's complement encoding for signed 32-bit integers.
- Added comprehensive tests for `Number` type covering roundtrip encoding/decoding, error cases, hex roundtrip, zero handling, and parser errors.

#### xrpl

- Added `flag` package with `Contains` utility function to check if a flag is fully set within a combined flag value.
- Added `Vault` ledger entry type with support for XRP, IOU, and MPT assets.
- Added vault transaction types:
  - `VaultCreate` - Creates a new vault with asset configuration, optional scale, and privacy/transferability flags.

  - `VaultDeposit` - Deposits assets into a vault.
  - `VaultWithdraw` - Withdraws assets from a vault, with optional `Destination` and `DestinationTag`.
  - `VaultClawback` - Claws back assets from a vault holder.
- Added `VaultWithdrawalPolicy` type with `VaultStrategyFirstComeFirstServe` constant for specifying vault withdrawal strategies.
- Added `vault_info` query for both RPC and WebSocket clients with lookup by `VaultID` or `Owner`+`Seq`, including `AssetsMaximum`, `Data`, and `Scale` fields in the response.
- Added `ManagementFeeOutstanding` and `LoanScale` fields to `Loan` ledger entry type.
- Added `ManagementFeeRate` and `Data` fields to `LoanBroker` ledger entry type.
- Added `LoanPay` transaction flags: `TfLoanPayOverpayment`, `TfLoanPayFullPayment`, `TfLoanPayLatePayment` with mutual exclusivity validation and flag setter methods.
- Added `DestinationTag` field to `LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw` transaction.
- Added `IsMPTCurrency` validation helper for MPT currency amounts, and updated `IsAmount` to support MPT amounts.
- Added `SignLoanSetByCounterparty` to sign a LoanSet transaction as the counterparty (single-sign or multisign).
- Added `SignLoanSetByCounterpartyBlob` convenience wrapper that accepts a hex-encoded transaction blob.
- Added `CombineLoanSetCounterpartySigners` to merge multiple counterparty multisig transactions into one.
- Added `CombineLoanSetCounterpartySignersBlob` convenience wrapper that accepts hex-encoded transaction blobs.
- Added integration test for full lending protocol lifecycle (VaultCreate → VaultDeposit → LoanBrokerSet → LoanSet with counterparty signing).

### Changed

#### binary-codec

- Refactored `Number` (STNumber) serialization to use `big.Int` mantissa instead of `int64`, supporting values that exceed the `int64` range. Updated mantissa bounds from 10^15–(10^16-1) to 10^18–(10^19-1), added rounding for mantissa truncation, underflow detection, and trailing-zero stripping in scientific/decimal formatting.
- Renamed `PreviousPaymentDate` to `PreviousPaymentDueDate` in `definitions.json`.

#### xrpl

- Extracted `Asset` to its own file and added MPT asset support in `IsAsset` validation.
- Renamed `PreviousPaymentDate` type to `PreviousPaymentDueDate` to align with protocol field naming.
- Updated `Loan` ledger entry `PreviousPaymentDate` field to `PreviousPaymentDueDate`.
- Make `ComputeSignature` public

### Fixed

#### binary-codec

#### xrpl

- Updated `AffectedNode` type fields to be a pointer to allow nil values.
- Fixed `BaseLedger` field in `ledger` response (v1 and v2). BaseLedger.Transactions is now an array of interfaces instead of a slice of `FlatTransaction` due to `Expand` field in the request.

## [v0.1.7]

### Added

#### xrpl

- Added `GatewayBalances` and `GetAggregatePrice` queries.

## [v0.1.2]

### Fixed

#### xrpl

- The `InfoRequest` for the `account_info` method had an incorrect field `signer_list` (an `s` was missing). The correct field is now `signer_lists`.  
  Link to the documentation [here](https://xrpl.org/docs/references/http-websocket-apis/public-api-methods/account-methods/account_info#request-format).
